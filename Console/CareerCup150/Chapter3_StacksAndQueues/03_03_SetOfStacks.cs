    /*
    Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, 
    in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. 
    Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of 
    several stacks, and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. 
    SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() 
    should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
    FOLLOW UP
    Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
