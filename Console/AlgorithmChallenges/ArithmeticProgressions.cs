         * Let F(a,d) denote an arithmetic progression (AP) with first term ‘a’ and common difference ‘d’. i.e  F(a,d) denotes an infinite AP => a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d,… You are given ‘n’ APs => F(a1,d1), F(a2,d2), F(a3,d3),… F(an,dn). Let G(a1,a2,… an,d1,d2,… dn) denote the sequence obtained by multiplying the ‘n’ APs.

        Multiplication of 2 sequences is defined as follows: Let the terms of the first sequence be A1, A2,… Am, and terms of the second sequence be B1, B2,… Bm. The sequence obtained by multiplying these two sequences is: A1*B1, A2*B2,… Am*Bm. We also give the definition for the kth difference of a sequence. If A1, A2,… Am,… be the terms of a sequence, then the terms of the 1st difference of this sequence are given by A2-A1, A3-A2,… Am-A(m-1),… In general, if A1, A2,… Am,… be the terms of the kth difference of a sequence, then the terms of the k+1th difference are given by A2-A1, A3-A2,… Am-A(m-1),… We say that the kth difference of a sequence is a constant, if all the terms of the kth difference are equal.

        Let F’(a,d,p) be a sequence defined as => a^p, (a+d)^p, (a+2d)^p,… Similarly, G’(a1,a2,… an,d1,d2,… dn,p1,p2,… pn) is defined as => product of F’(a1,d1,p1), F’(a2,d2,p2),… F’(an,dn,pn). Now, your task is to find the smallest ‘k’ for which the kth difference of the sequence G’ is a constant. You are also required to find this constant value.

 

        You will be given many operations. Each operation is of one of the 2 forms:

        1) 0 i j => 0 indicates a query (1<=i<=j<=n).You are required to find the smallest ‘k’ for which the  kth difference of G’(ai,ai+1,… aj,di,di+1,… dj,pi,pi+1,… pj) is a constant. You should also output this constant value.

        2) 1 i j v => 1 indicates an update (1<=i<=j<=n). For all i<=k<=j, we update pk = pk+v.

        Input:

        The first line of input contains a single integer ‘n’, denoting the number of APs. Each of the next ‘n’ lines consists of 3 integers ai, di, pi (1<=i<=n). The next line consists of a single integer ‘q’, denoting the number of operations. Each of the next ‘q’ lines consist of one of the two operations mentioned above.

 

        Output:

        For each query, output a single line containing 2 space separated integers ‘K’ and ‘V’. ‘K’ is the least value for which the Kth difference of the required sequence is a constant. ‘V’ is the value of this constant. Since ‘V’ might be large, output the value of ‘V’ modulo 1000003.

 

        Note: ‘K’ will always be such that it fits into a signed 64-bit integer. All indices for query and update are 1-based. Do not take modulo 1000003 for ‘K’.

 

        Constraints:
        1<=n<=100000
        1<=ai, di, pi<=10000
        1<=q<=100000
        For updates of the form “1 i j v”, 1 <= v <= 10000
 

        Sample Input:
        2
        1 2 1
        5 3 1
        3
        0 1 2
        1 1 1 1
        0 1 1

        Sample Output:
        2 12
        2 8

        Explanation:

        The first sequence given in the input is => 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,…
        The second sequence given in the input is => 5, 8, 11, 14, 17,…

        For the first query operation, we have to consider the product of these two sequences:
        => 1*5, 3*8, 5*11, 7*14, 9*17,…
        => 5, 24, 55, 98, 153,…
        First difference is => 19, 31, 43, 55,…
        Second difference is => 12, 12, 12,… This is a constant and hence the output is “2 12”.

        After the update operation “1 1 1 1”, the first sequence becomes => 1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2,…
        i.e => 1, 9, 25, 49, 81,…
        For the second query, we consider only the first sequence => 1, 9, 25, 49, 81,…
        First difference is => 8, 16, 24, 32,…
        Second difference is => 8, 8, 8,… This is a constant and hence the output is “2 8”
