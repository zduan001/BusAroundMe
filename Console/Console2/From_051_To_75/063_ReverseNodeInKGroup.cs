            If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
            You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
            Only constant memory is allowed.

             Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5 
            For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5 
            For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

        // so I need keep reference to previouEndNode, currentStartNode, currentEndNode, 
        // extStartNode.
        // I'll code it later.
