         * You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2 … AN-1}. There are K painters available 
         * and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have 
         * to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only 
         * paint continuous sections of board, say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but 
         * not board {2, 4, 5}.
